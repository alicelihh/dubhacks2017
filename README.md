Dubhacks: 
Challenge:
Reimagine a tool of today to cultivate equity and access for everyone tomorrow.

We want to improve the condition of people being sexual harassed, by raising awareness on the use of language. We want to educate people on the appropriate languages that could be used when talking to someone. Just like the rules of grammar, we want people to approach each other with the correct use of words and phrases, making it a safe and satisfying environment for everyone to communicate and without being hurt and offended. 
We give women the opportunity to speak out for themselves, rejecting language that makes them feel uncomfortable. In fact in the future, this application could be accessed by everyone, of every cultural or racial groups, serving as a protection for them as well.
Our application is education purpose based, because we realize how difficult it is to wipe out such behaviour, since it is so deeply rooted. The most effective way is the step by step approach, which makes people understand why it is not okay to use inappropriate languages and how such behaviour could influence other people. Potentially, the mental awareness of cautiously using language will evolve to physical behaviours.


Future implications:
We would like to integrate such application with multiple media platforms. The proper language use will be learned and used by more people as more media platforms adapt to such communication awareness. After maturing the language detection of inappropriate words, we would like to further implement offensive messages within other agents like graphics and voice speeches.
