Dubhacks: 
Challenge:
Reimagine a tool of today to cultivate equity and access for everyone tomorrow.

We want to improve the condition of people being sextual harassed, by raising awareness on the use of language. We want to educate people on the appropriate languages that could be used when talking to someone. Just like the rules of grammar, we want people to approach each other with the correct use of words and phrases, making it a safe and satisfying environment for everyone to communicate and without being hurt and offended.
